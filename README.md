# Fundamentals of Computer Algorithms
This algorithms course was taken at Northeastern University while working on my Master's in Data Science during the Fall 2023 semester.

## Overview
This course introduces students to the analysis and design of computer algorithms. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to do the following:
- Analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms.
- Demonstrate a familiarity with major algorithms and data structures.
- Apply important algorithmic design paradigms and methods of analysis.
- Synthesize efficient algorithms in common engineering design situations.
